# Julia-Ray-Tracing

I developed this software as final project for MIT course 18.337 (Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning). It includes a renderer that supports spherical and triangular geometries, along with a simple radiative transfer model of a toy planetary atmosphere.

This is still very much a work-in-progress, with many potential areas of improvement (some noted in the code, others in the report). I plan to continue developing this software and updating this repository (or creating a new one, if the situation calls for it) once the dust settles from the semester.
